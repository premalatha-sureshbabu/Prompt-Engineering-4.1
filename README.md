# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 2 with Comparative Analysis Prompt, Comparative Analysis Prompt and Prompt Size Limitations
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

## Algorithm:
Collect user preferences: destination, duration, interests, and budget.

Apply different prompt techniques: zero-shot, role-based, few-shot, chain-of-thought.

Generate AI outputs for personalized travel plans.

Compare responses from ChatGPT and Gemini.

Analyze creativity, contextual relevance, and user experience.

Summarize findings.
